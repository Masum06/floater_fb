Floater_fb is created by Md Mahmudul Hasan (Masum), an undergraduate student of Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.
Masum created the Floater Web Browser with his partners Tareq Mahmood and Tanjim Rium as a term project of Object Oriented Programming. Later he decides to modify only his part of the idea and code to make a Facebook app named Floater_fb to understand the acceptance of the Floater Web Browser, which will be released in 2016.
He also wants to make a Floater_YouTube along with the full browser.
